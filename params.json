{"name":"Benjamin R. Balzer","tagline":"GHPages intro","body":"This is to be the blog wherein I document my pathing through front-end full-stack dev curriculum, beginning with the MEAN stack and continuing from there via [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/benjaminbalzer), [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/benjamin-r-balzer), [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/BenjaminRBalzer), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5831343/benjamin-balzer?tab=profile), and of course here on [GitHub](https://github.com/Benjamin-R-Balzer). As a self-fueled and impassioned programmer-to-be, I've compiled several resources to work from and round out my education on the languages to tackle (and why), as well as the environments I'll be employed in down the road. Not only am I looking at what future clients/projects will be interested in hiring me for, I'm also making sure to be aware of the pitfalls of the occupation regarding physical and mental health. I'll be updating this sometime this weekend, and fleshing out the blog element to journal my progress properly, but here are a few of the aforementioned links off the top of my head:\r\n* [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming)\r\n* [How a non-techie learned to code from scratch](https://medium.com/swlh/how-a-non-techie-learned-to-code-from-scratch-54800e196819#.rv1tv2hze)\r\n* [Top 5 mistakes made by bootcamp alumni](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/how-to-avoid-the-top-5-mistakes-made-by-coding-bootcamp-alumni)\r\n* [What the JavaScript Job Market Really Looks Like in 2016.](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/forget-the-click-bait-here-s-what-the-javascript-job-market-really-looks-like-in-2016-ddfe0d39b467#.orhdr9wfq)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking (those mystical few who happen to find this infinitesimally small corner of the internet somehow), there'll be more later, don't you worry none.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nBenjamin","google":"UA-73055799-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
